# They Come At Night
- Move left and right with A/D keys and attack enemies with M
- Jump with W. You can wall jump by pressing W after touching a wall
- Kill all enemies and touch the moon at the end to pass the level
- Don't let your health reach zero! Coming into contact with enemies and spikes will damage you.
- This game was made as the final project for the UCF Summer Unity Camp 2018 over the span of about 4 days, and as such may contain many bugs
- All game design and programming was done by me (Samantha Lin)

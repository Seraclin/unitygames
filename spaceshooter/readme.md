# Space Shooter by Samantha Lin
- Shoot enemy spaceships with the space bar and move around with W, A, S, D. 
- Avoid enemy attacks, they will instantly kill you if you get hit!
- This game was put together in a space-themed game jam with about a 2 hour time limit, so this is far from a polished product and may contain bugs.
- All coding and game design was done by me (Samantha Lin)
- Assets are not mine, and belong to their respective owners.
